# Archipelago Playthrough Despoiler

A program for finding the available progress in Archipelago, without revealing too much information.

Takes the full playthrough from an Archipelago spoiler file, and removes already found progress using a sphere tracker. Both files should be linked in settings.yaml

Can be configured to reveal the 1 check at a time (slowest, but minumum spoilers), 1 sphere at a time (gives multiple options without spoilers) or the whole playthrough (most info & most spoilers)

Can also be configured to hide item names (minimize spoilers) or show them (lets you prioritize important items)
